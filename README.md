# ðŸ¤– Telegram Echo Bot with Username Tracker

This is a simple Telegram bot built using the `python-telegram-bot` library. It greets users, responds to basic messages, and keeps track of usernames by saving them into a local `usernames.json` file.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Greets users with `/start`
- Replies with a help message on `/help`
- Echoes any text messages sent to the bot
- Special responses for:
  - `hello` â†’ `hello`
  - `good bye` â†’ `goodbye`
- Saves every unique username to `usernames.json`

## ðŸ§  How It Works

When a user interacts with the bot:
- Their Telegram username is checked.
- If it's new, it's saved into `usernames.json`.
- Depending on the command or message, the bot replies accordingly.
